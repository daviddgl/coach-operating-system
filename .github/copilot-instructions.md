# Copilot Instructions (Coach Operating System)

## Architecture
- `01_KERNEL`: coaching philosophy, decision protocol, personal DNA
- `02_CONFIG`: practice mission and strategy
- `03_DRIVERS`: client portfolio and client cards
- `04_PROCESSES`: quarter plan
- `05_COMMANDS`: command reference and system prompt
- `06_BOARDROOM`: advisory personas

## Editing rules
- Preserve layer boundaries
- Keep commands grounded in file references
- Avoid adding domain-specific assumptions not requested by user
- Keep coaching boundaries explicit in decision-support outputs

## Maintenance
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for framework-level changes
- Keep `00_BOOT/bootstrap_prompt.md` static unless architecture changes
