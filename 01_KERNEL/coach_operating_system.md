## What Is This File?

**Coach Operating System** is your personal coaching playbook. It defines how you think, decide, and operate — your philosophy, standards, communication style, and protocols. This is the core of what makes you a coach, and it travels with you across clients and practice contexts.

Every command reads sections from this file because it's your source of truth for:
- Philosophy and values (§1)
- Client expectations (§2)
- Decision protocols (§3, §8)
- Feedback style (§6)
- Coaching standards (§10)
- Self-management in stress (§12)

**Update frequency:** Rarely (once set, evolves over years, not quarters)  
**Used by:** ALL commands (most frequently: `client_request`, `boundary_check`, `prep_session`, `init_week`)  
**Most critical sections:** §1 (Philosophy), §3 (Capacity Contract), §12 (Pressure Mode)

---

## 1. The Kernel: Core Coaching Philosophy

**Purpose Statement:** [Write your coaching purpose in one sentence. What is your role? Who do you serve? What do you unlock?]

> *Example: "I help mid-career professionals navigate transitions with clarity and confidence by unlocking their strengths, challenging their limiting beliefs, and building a concrete path forward."*

### Core Values (The DNA)

<!-- List 3-5 values that define how you coach. These should be non-negotiable principles that travel with you to any client or context. -->

1. **[Value 1]:** [Definition — what does this mean in practice?]
2. **[Value 2]:** [Definition]
3. **[Value 3]:** [Definition]
4. **[Value 4]:** [Definition]
5. **[Value 5]:** [Definition]

---

## 2. Client Expectations & Relationship Spec

**Goal:** [What kind of relationship do you want with your coachees?]

<!-- List the expectations you set for any client engagement. These are your non-negotiable working agreements, shared at intake. -->

* **[Expectation 1]:** [Description — e.g., "Come prepared: review your notes and action items before each session"]
* **[Expectation 2]:** [Description — e.g., "Be honest: the quality of coaching scales with the quality of your candour"]
* **[Expectation 3]:** [Description — e.g., "Do the work: insights without action are just conversations"]
* **[Expectation 4]:** [Description]
* **[Expectation 5]:** [Description]

---

## 3. The Capacity Contract (Coaching vs. Admin vs. Business Development)

**Goal:** Prevent the "Hidden Factory" of admin and business development work from consuming client-facing coaching time.

### The Principle

* Every quarter I operate under a **Capacity Contract** — a predefined split between Client Coaching, Business Development, and Administration. The specific ratio is defined in the **Client Portfolio**.
* **The "Red Line" Trigger:** If Admin or Biz Dev work consistently exceeds the contracted ratio:
  * **Action:** Review and adjust the client load or business commitments.
  * **Script:** *"I am currently spending [X]% of my time on [admin/biz dev]. To maintain coaching quality for [Client/Program Y], I must drop [Z commitment] or accept a decline in outcomes. Which do I prefer?"*

### The "No" Logic

When a new client or commitment arrives that threatens existing capacity:

* **IF** the request is urgent and mission-critical (e.g., a long-term client in crisis) $\rightarrow$ **ACCEPT** immediately, protect time by deferring admin.
* **IF** the request is "important" but not urgent $\rightarrow$ **NEGOTIATE**.
  * *Question:* "If I take this on, which existing commitment am I reducing or pausing?"

<!-- Customize the negotiation scripts above to match your communication style. -->

---

## 4. Communication Protocol

**Goal:** [What communication problem are you solving? e.g., "Eliminate reactive email to protect deep coaching time"]

### The Session & Meeting Filter

A session or meeting is **automatically declined / restructured** if it does not meet these specs:

1. **Clear Outcome:** What does the client (or partner) want to leave with?
2. **Right Format:** Is a full session needed, or would a quick check-in or async message suffice?
3. **Timing:** Is this the best moment in the client's process for this conversation?

### Communication Channel Rules

* **Session booking:** [Your scheduling tool — e.g., Calendly, Acuity]
* **Between-session support:** [Your preferred channel — e.g., voice notes via Voxer, async messages in CoachAccountable, email]
* **Urgent (client crisis):** [Your availability protocol — e.g., text/WhatsApp for genuine emergencies only]
* **Admin (invoices, contracts):** [Your tool — e.g., HoneyBook, Dubsado, email]

### The Output Rule

No session ends without:
1. **Key Insight:** What did the client discover?
2. **Action Items:** What will the client do before the next session? (Logged in [your session notes tool])
3. **Next Session Focus:** Tentative theme for the next conversation.

---

## 5. Coaching Mode Selector (Situational Logic)

**Goal:** Apply the right coaching approach based on the client's context and session type.

| Context | Coaching Mode | Behaviour |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discovery / Early engagement** | **Exploratory (Default)** | Ask open questions. Let the client surface their own insight. Resist the urge to advise. |
| **Job search / Interview prep / CV** | **Directive** | Give concrete, specific feedback. The client needs tools, not just reflection. |
| **Accountability check-in** | **Accountability** | Review commitments made. Hold the client to what they said they wanted. Be direct. |
| **Confidence crisis / Transition shock** | **Supportive** | Prioritise emotional safety. Validate before challenging. |
| **Group workshop / Team coaching** | **Facilitative** | Design the container, not the content. Draw out the group's wisdom. |

<!-- Adjust modes and behaviours to match your coaching style. Add or remove rows. -->

---

## 6. The Feedback Loop

**Goal:** Continuous improvement through honest, concrete feedback in both directions.

### Outbound (You to Client)

* **Specificity Rule:** Feedback must be **concrete**.
  * *Bad:* "You need to be more confident in interviews."
  * *Good:* "In today's mock interview, you answered the 'Tell me about yourself' question by listing job titles. That misses the narrative arc. Let's reframe it around the transition story you want to tell."
* **Timing:** [Immediate in-session? Written summary after? In next check-in?]

### Inbound (Client to You)

* **Synchronous:** [How do you invite feedback? e.g., "What is one thing I'm doing in our sessions that isn't useful for you right now?"]
* **Asynchronous:** [Feedback form after sessions? End-of-programme survey? How do you make it safe to be honest?]

---

## 7. Experimentation & Risk Protocol

**Goal:** Encourage the client to try new approaches without catastrophising failure.

### The "Safe Test" Timebox

* **Concept:** Clients can experiment with new behaviours, scripts, or strategies — but strictly timeboxed.
* **The Rule:** *"Try this for [X Days / in your next [N] interactions]. Then we evaluate. No commitment beyond that."*
* **Early Warning Signal:** If an experiment is going wrong, encourage clients to flag it *before* the next session, not after.
  * *Constraint:* "Bad news early gives us time to adjust. Surprises at the deadline don't."

---

## 8. Managing Stakeholders (The Practice Interface)

**Goal:** Build trust with referral partners, organizational sponsors, and the professional network to sustain and grow the practice.

### The "No Surprises" Practice Update

* **Frequency:** [Quarterly / Per programme cycle]
* **Format (for corporate sponsors / HR partners):**
    1. **Programme Status:** On track / At risk / Completed.
    2. **Aggregate Outcomes:** What progress are participants making? (anonymised)
    3. **The Ask:** What do I need from you to make this programme more effective?
* **The "Solution" Rule:** Never present a problem without a proposed solution.
  * *Template:* *"We have a challenge with [X]. My recommendation is [Option A] because [Reason]. We could also do [Option B]. What would work best for you?"*

> **Note for independent coaches:** If you work only with individual private clients, this section governs how you communicate with referral partners, intake leads, and your professional network rather than an employer or client company.

---

## 9. Success Metrics (KPIs)

<!-- Define 3-5 metrics that tell you "things are going well" as a coach. These should be YOUR metrics, aligned with your coaching philosophy. -->

* **[Metric 1]:** [Description and target — e.g., "Client goal completion rate: ≥80% of clients achieve their primary goal by programme end"]
* **[Metric 2]:** [Description and target — e.g., "Net Promoter Score (NPS): ≥9 average after programme completion"]
* **[Metric 3]:** [Description and target — e.g., "Client retention rate: ≥60% renew or refer within 6 months"]
* **[Metric 4]:** [Description and target — e.g., "Session attendance: ≤1 missed session per programme"]
* **[Metric 5]:** [Description and target — e.g., "Referral rate: ≥30% of new clients come from referrals"]

---

## 10. Coaching Standards (Portable)

> *These standards travel with you to any client or context. They are your non-negotiable professional baselines.*

<!-- Customize these to your coaching philosophy and certification. Remove or add as needed. -->

* **[Standard 1]:** [Description — e.g., "Sessions begin with a clear contracting question: 'What do you want to achieve in this session, and how will you know we've succeeded?'"]
* **[Standard 2]:** [Description — e.g., "Session notes are written within 24 hours and stored in [your tool]. Every session has: Key Insight + Actions + Next Session Focus."]
* **[Standard 3]:** [Description — e.g., "Confidentiality is absolute. Nothing shared in sessions is disclosed without explicit written consent, except where mandatory disclosure applies (safety)."]
* **[Standard 4]:** [Description — e.g., "I coach within my competence. When a client's situation requires therapy, legal advice, or specialist expertise, I refer — not coach through it."]
* **[Standard 5]:** [Description — e.g., "I adhere to the ICF Code of Ethics (or equivalent professional body). I participate in regular supervision and CPD to maintain competence."]

<!-- Reference your professional certification body here (ICF, EMCC, AC, etc.) if applicable. -->

---

## 11. Practice Values in Action

> *Your personal interpretation of your practice's core values in client-facing work. Update this when your practice mission evolves.*

<!-- Since you own your practice, this is a self-alignment check: how do your stated values show up in day-to-day coaching decisions? -->

| Practice Value (Static) | How It Shows Up in Coaching (This Quarter) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[Value 1]** | [How you implement this in sessions and client relationships] |
| **[Value 2]** | [How you implement this in sessions and client relationships] |
| **[Value 3]** | [How you implement this in sessions and client relationships] |

---

## 12. Pressure Mode Protocol (Self-Management)

> *The system assumes the coach is in a resourceful state. This section exists for when that assumption breaks.*

### Activation Triggers (Stress Indicators)

If **two or more** of these are true, activate Pressure Mode:

- [ ] Over-scheduling clients to avoid revenue anxiety
- [ ] Giving advice instead of coaching (switching from Exploratory to Directive when the client hasn't asked for it)
- [ ] Skipping session prep — entering a session cold
- [ ] Avoiding the difficult feedback a client needs to hear
- [ ] Feeling resentful about a client's lack of progress (boundary signal)
- [ ] Feeling isolated — "no one understands the trade-offs I'm navigating in my practice"

<!-- Add your own stress indicators — what patterns do YOU exhibit under pressure? -->

### Pressure Mode Rules

1. **SLOW DOWN:** Take 2 minutes before any session or business decision. Write it down before acting.
2. **GET SECOND OPINION:** Never make a consequential decision about a client or the practice alone under pressure. Use Isolation Breakers (below).
3. **DOCUMENT REASONING:** Write why you're choosing X over Y — if you can't articulate it, invoke Rule Zero.
4. **SET REVIEW POINT:** "Let's revisit this after the next session / in 24 hours" is always a valid response for non-urgent issues.

### Isolation Breakers

*When you feel alone with a decision, pick a resource by decision type:*

| Decision Type | Who to Call | Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Client situation** | [Peer coach / Supervisor] | 3-bullet context + specific question |
| **Practice ethics** | [Professional body / Mentor coach] | Framing: "I need a sounding board on [situation]" |
| **Business / Pricing** | [Business mentor / Peer group] | Use Capacity Contract data as the conversation starter |
| **Career / Strategic** | [Coach supervisor / Mastermind group] | 15-min request with clear ask |

### Recovery

After any decision made under pressure:

* **Document:** What was decided → What Kernel rule was applied → What alternatives existed
* **Review at 24h:** Was this the right call? Would calm-you have decided differently?
* **Pattern Log:** If the same pressure scenario repeats, add it to this section as a known pattern.

## 13. System I/O & Memory (External Resources)

> *This OS processes logic, but stores data in external tools. Markdown files = Code (how I work). External tools = Database (what I work on).*

* **Client Memory ([Your CRM / coaching platform]):**
    * *Role:* The Source of Truth for *Client Status*, *Session History*, and *Action Items*.
    * *Rule:* If it's not in [CRM], it's not being tracked.
    * *Examples: CoachAccountable, Practice, HoneyBook, Notion, simple spreadsheet*
* **Scheduling ([Your booking tool]):**
    * *Role:* The Source of Truth for *Session Calendar*.
    * *Rule:* All sessions booked through [tool]. No ad-hoc calendar adds without CRM update.
    * *Examples: Calendly, Acuity, TidyCal*
* **Session Notes ([Your notes tool]):**
    * *Role:* Permanent knowledge base for session insights, client goals, and patterns.
    * *Rule:* Every session gets a note within 24 hours. Key Insight + Actions + Next Session Focus.
* **Communication ([Your messaging tool]):**
    * *Role:* Ephemeral between-session contact.
    * *Rule:* Decisions or commitments made here must be committed to CRM or session notes. Messaging is not a source of truth.
