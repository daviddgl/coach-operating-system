## What Is This File?

**Personal DNA** is your coaching identity file. It captures who you are as a coach — your goals, fears, success metrics, and behavioural patterns. The AI uses this to:
- Detect when you're in **Pressure Mode** (about to repeat old patterns)
- Personalise recommendations in commands like `prep_session` and `init_day`
- Understand your constraints and aspirations
- Provide context for decision-making

**Update frequency:** Quarterly + after major wins/failures  
**Used by:** `prep_session`, `init_day`, `shutdown_day`, `client_request`, `boundary_check`, Pressure Mode detection  
**Critical sections:** Constraints & Fears (powers Pressure Mode detection), Goals (guides 90-day focus)
