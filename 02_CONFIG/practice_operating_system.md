## What Is This File?

**Practice Operating System** documents your coaching practice's mission, vision, and core values. As an independent coach, this is **self-authored** — you define it, own it, and update it when your practice evolves. It is the identity foundation that grounds all your decisions.

> **Note:** If you coach within an organisation (employer, academy, or corporate programme), this file instead documents your employer's mission and values — the inherited context you operate within, similar to how a manager inherits company culture.

This file provides context for understanding your practice strategy and translating values into client engagement decisions.

**Update frequency:** When your practice mission, niche, or service model changes significantly (not quarterly — this is foundational)  
**Used by:** Strategic context for all commands; directly read in `prep_program`, `retro`, `onboard_client`  
**Why it matters:** Grounds your client and business decisions in practice identity

## 1. Identity & Purpose

**Mission:** [Your coaching practice's mission statement — why you exist and who you serve]

> *Example: "To help mid-career professionals navigate transitions with clarity and confidence, so they land roles that align with their values, not just their CV."*

**Vision:** [Where your practice is heading long-term — what impact you want to have]

> *Example: "A world where career transitions are guided by self-knowledge and strategy, not fear — and where every professional has access to the coaching support they deserve."*

## 2. Core Values (The Practice DNA)

*These are the immutable principles that define how you coach and how you run your practice.*

> *Note: Your personal coaching philosophy lives in the Kernel → Coach Operating System §1. This section contains your practice-level values — how you show up as a business and a professional, not just as a coach in session.*

<!-- Copy your practice values below. Keep them clean and principled — your session-level interpretation goes in COS §11, not here. -->

### ⭐️ [Value 1]

**Definition:** [What this value means for your practice — e.g., "Client-Centred: Every decision — from pricing to programme design — puts the client's long-term development ahead of short-term revenue"]

### ⭐️ [Value 2]

**Definition:** [e.g., "Radical Honesty: We tell clients what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. Growth happens at the edge of comfort."]

### ⭐️ [Value 3]

**Definition:** [e.g., "Sustainable Pace: We model the wellbeing we coach. We don't over-promise or over-deliver at the expense of quality."]

### ⭐️ [Value 4]

**Definition:** [Your definition]

### ⭐️ [Value 5]

**Definition:** [Your definition]

## 3. Niche & Ideal Client Profile

**Coaching Niche:** [Specific area where you specialise — be specific. e.g., "Career transitions from individual contributor to first-time manager in the tech industry"]

**Ideal Client:**

* **Career Stage:** [e.g., "5–15 years of experience, hitting a ceiling or facing a crossroads"]
* **Mindset:** [e.g., "Self-aware, willing to be challenged, coachable — not looking for a quick fix"]
* **Common Presenting Goals:** [e.g., "Wants a promotion, changing industries, returning after career break, preparing for leadership role"]
* **What makes the coaching relationship thrive:** [e.g., "They do the homework, they show up fully, they trust the process even when it's uncomfortable"]

**Who is NOT your ideal client:**

<!-- Being clear about who you don't coach reduces scope creep and helps you refer appropriately. -->

* [e.g., "Clients seeking therapy or mental health support — I refer these to qualified professionals"]
* [e.g., "Clients who want a job-search service rather than coaching — I coach the person, not the process"]
* [e.g., "Executives at C-suite level requiring organisational strategy — outside my scope"]
