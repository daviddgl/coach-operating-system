## What Is This File?

**Practice Strategy** captures the current North Star — your coaching practice's #1 goal and any supporting OKRs for this quarter. It's the "source of truth" for your business priorities as an independent coach.

Commands use this to:
- Check alignment in `client_request` (Gate 2: Does this client or engagement align with practice goals?)
- Prioritise in `init_week` and `prep_program`
- Evaluate risks in `capacity_check`

**Update frequency:** Quarterly (with new goals) or ad-hoc if your strategy pivots  
**Used by:** `init_week`, `prep_program`, `capacity_check`, `client_request`, `boundary_check`, `retro`  
**Most important:** §1 North Star — the one metric/goal everything else aligns to

**Theme:** [One-line theme for the quarter — e.g., "Deepen Impact, Protect Capacity" or "Launch Group Programme" or "Build Referral Pipeline"]
