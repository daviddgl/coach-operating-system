## What Is This File?

**Quarterly Plan** is your current roadmap — the 2–4 big goals for this quarter, key milestones, and risks. It translates practice strategy into concrete execution across both client delivery and business development.

Commands use this to:
- Prioritise work in `init_week` and `init_day`
- Check what's complete in `shutdown_week`
- Identify capacity available in `capacity_check`
- Evaluate new client requests in `client_request` (is this on the plan or new scope?)
- Facilitate retros in `retro`

**Update frequency:** Quarterly (new plan each Q) + mid-quarter if strategy pivots  
**Used by:** `init_week`, `init_day`, `shutdown_day`, `shutdown_week`, `prep_program`, `capacity_check`, `retro`, `client_request`  
**Critical sections:** §1 (Goals — what are the 2–4 priorities?), §2 (Risks — what could derail the quarter?)

---

**Theme:** [One-line theme — e.g., "Build the Group Programme" or "Deepen Relationships, Grow Pipeline"]
**Goal:** [Main objective for the quarter]
**Date:** [Quarter and Year — e.g., Q1 2026 (Jan - Mar)]
