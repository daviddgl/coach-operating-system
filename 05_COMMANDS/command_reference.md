# Command Reference

> **Layer:** COMMANDS  
> **Owner:** [Your Name]  
> **Version:** 2026.02  
> **Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
> **Portable:** Yes

---

**Purpose:** This file defines the Coach Operating System (COS) command layer — named operations that an AI copilot executes using OS files as context.

**How to use:** Type the command name (e.g., `init_week`) in your AI conversation. The AI reads this reference, loads the specified OS files, asks for missing inputs, and produces the structured output.

---

## Command Categories

1. **Lifecycle** — Daily and weekly bookends (init/shutdown cycles)
2. **People** — Client interactions (session prep, onboarding)
3. **Execution** — Program planning and capacity management
4. **Decision Support** — Incoming requests, boundary checks, and boardroom sessions
5. **Maintenance** — System refresh and version upgrades

---

## File Freshness Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 🔴 | 0-day grace — must be current before command runs |
| 🟡 | 3–7 day grace — warn if stale, proceed with caution |
| 🟢 | 30-day grace — reference-only, low urgency |

---

## Command Chaining Overview

```
Monday:
  init_week → [weekly plan stored]
    Each day:
      init_day → [daily priorities]
      (prep_session before each session)
      shutdown_day → [carryover captured]
  Friday:
    shutdown_week → [compares to init_week output]

Quarter end:
  retro → quarterly_reset → prep_program

New request:
  client_request → [accept/negotiate/decline]
  (if uncertain: boardroom first)

Scope/ethics concern:
  boundary_check → [action or escalation]

Maintenance:
  prep_refresh → (then resume normal commands)
  version_upgrade → init_week (verify)
```

---

## Usage Instructions

1. **Upload all COS files** (or `cos_compiled.md` bundle) to your AI platform knowledge base
2. **Paste `00_BOOT/bootstrap_prompt.md`** into Custom Instructions / Gem instructions / Project instructions — do this once; it never changes
3. **Type a command name** in the conversation (e.g., `init_week`)
4. **AI will:** read this reference → load OS files → run freshness checks → ask for inputs → produce structured output
5. **Keep outputs in session** — commands chain within a conversation; `shutdown_week` can reference `init_week` output from the same session

**Purpose:** Full system refresh — archive the old quarter, update all layers, plan the new quarter

**OS Files to Read:**
- **All files** — full system review
- `00_BOOT/README.md` — quarterly maintenance section

**Ask User For:**
- Previous quarter's outcomes (client milestones, revenue, program delivery %)
- New quarter's strategic direction (from practice_strategy update)
- Client roster changes (new clients, graduated clients, paused relationships)
- Any company value, pricing model, or niche updates
- Specific risks from the previous quarter to address going forward

**Critical Files for Freshness:**
- ⚠️ All files will be updated during this reset
- Start with the most stale files first (run `prep_refresh` first if needed)

**Output Format:**
```
# Quarterly Reset — [Q(X) → Q(X+1)]

## Quarter Retrospective
- **Client outcomes:** [% coaching goals significantly progressed or achieved]
- **Program delivery:** [% milestones hit vs planned]
- **Capacity ratio average:** [Coaching / Biz Dev / Admin]
- **Practice health:** [Revenue trend, roster size trend]

## 🔧 MAINTENANCE COMMANDS

### `prep_refresh`

**Trigger:** When file freshness warnings appear during command execution, or as monthly maintenance  
**Purpose:** Audit all OS files for staleness and refresh only the stale sections — not a full rewrite

**OS Files to Read:**
- **All files** — scan each file's `Last Updated` header against expected refresh frequency (automatic check)

**Ask User For:**
- *Determined by command logic* — only asks about files that are stale based on the freshness table below
- No fixed questions; questions are generated dynamically based on which files are overdue

**Critical Files for Freshness:**

This command scans all files. Freshness table (used to calculate staleness):

| File | Expected Refresh | Grace Period |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| `quarterly_plan.md` | Weekly (active quarter) | 0 days |
| `client_card - [Name].md` | Monthly (per active client) | 7 days |
| `client_portfolio.md` | Quarterly | 3 days |
| `practice_strategy.md` | Quarterly | 3 days |
| `practice_operating_system.md` | Annually or on pivot | 30 days |
| `coach_operating_system.md` | Annually or on evolution | 30 days |
| `personal_dna.md` | Annually or as needed | 30 days |
| `coach_decision_protocol.md` | Annually or as needed | 30 days |

**Output Format:**
```
# File Refresh — [Date]

## Staleness Audit
| File | Last Updated | Expected Refresh | Days Overdue | Priority |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| [File 1] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [Frequency] | [#] days | 🔴 / 🟡 / 🟢 |
[Order by priority — most overdue first]

---

## Files Requiring Refresh (Priority Order)

### 🔴 [Most Urgent File]

**What has changed since [last update date]?**

**Targeted questions — select which apply:**

- If `quarterly_plan.md`: What changed in the plan since last update? New priorities, dropped milestones, new risks?
- If `client_card - [Name].md`: Has the client's primary goal shifted? Any new context, life events, or coaching focus changes?
- If `client_portfolio.md`: Roster changes? Capacity contract still accurate? Referral network updates?
- If `practice_strategy.md`: Has the North Star evolved? Any niche, pricing, or positioning changes?
- If `coach_operating_system.md`: New patterns to log in Pressure Mode? Values evolution? Updated protocols?
- If `personal_dna.md`: Have your 90-day goals changed? New constraints? Avoidance patterns evolved?

**Updated section:**
[User provides summary of what changed — AI drafts the updated file section]

---

### 🟡 [Second Priority File]
[Repeat above structure]

---

### 🟢 [Low Priority — No Immediate Action]
[List files within their grace window — noting when they next come due]

---

## Updated File Headers (Ready to Paste)

```markdown
> **Last Updated:** [TODAY in YYYY-MM-DD]
```

Apply this to all files refreshed in this session.

## What NOT to Change

Only update what has actually changed. Do **not** rewrite the entire file — that is `quarterly_reset`.

**Examples:**
- ✅ Client goal shifted? → Update `client_card §3` only
- ✅ New risk identified? → Add to `quarterly_plan §2` only
- ❌ Don't rewrite the full coaching philosophy because one value evolved
```

**Chains With:** Always feeds forward — after refreshing, the next command you run will see current "Last Updated" dates and won't trigger stale warnings. Run before `version_upgrade` to ensure your data is complete before framework changes are applied.

---

### `version_upgrade [target_version]`

**Trigger:** When a new COS framework version is released — typed as `version_upgrade`, `version_upgrade [target_version]`, or `version_upgrade --remote`  
**Purpose:** Upgrade from your current COS version to a newer one while preserving all your data. Supports two modes:
- **Local mode** (default): reads CHANGELOG.md already loaded in the conversation
- **Remote mode** (`--remote` flag, or when CHANGELOG is missing/outdated): fetches `CHANGELOG.md` and changed template files from the COS GitHub repository via web browsing

**OS Files to Read:**
- **All files** — detect current version from `Version:` headers
- `CHANGELOG.md` — read all entries between current and target version (local or remote)

**External Tools / Live Data:**
- **GitHub raw file access** (Remote mode only) — browse the following URLs:
  - CHANGELOG: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daviddgl/coach-operating-system/main/CHANGELOG.md`
  - Individual changed files: same base URL + file path (e.g., `.../main/03_DRIVERS/client_portfolio.md`)
  - File list derived from CHANGELOG `### Added` / `### Changed` entries
  - Fallback: if browsing fails, ask user to paste the new `CHANGELOG.md` content manually

**Ask User For:**
- Target version to upgrade to (e.g., `2026.08`) — or detect latest from remote CHANGELOG
- Confirmation before applying each migration step
- Generate inline bundle after migration? (Y/N) — for bundled-deployment users (Gemini Gems, ChatGPT)

**Critical Files for Freshness:**
- All files will have their `Version` field updated during upgrade
- `Last Updated` field is preserved — your refresh dates remain accurate

**Output Format:**
```
# Version Upgrade — [Current Version] → [Target Version]

## Current State
- **Your Version:** [Detected from file headers]
- **Latest Version:** [From CHANGELOG — local or remote]
- **Versions to Apply:** [List intermediate versions if jumping more than one]
- **Source:** Local CHANGELOG / Remote GitHub fetch

---

## Change Summary

### Added (New content)
- [New files, commands, or sections from CHANGELOG]

### Changed (Modified content)
- [Renamed/restructured items from CHANGELOG]

### Removed (Deprecated content)
- [Deprecated features from CHANGELOG]

---

## Migration Plan

Total steps: [#]

---

### Step 1: [Action from CHANGELOG Migration Steps]

**Type:** Added / Changed / Removed

**What's changing:**
[Description from CHANGELOG]

**Your action:**
- If Added: [Template section to fill in with your data]
- If Changed: [Diff between old and new structure — adapt your content]
- If Removed: [Confirm archiving and what to delete]

**Ready to proceed?** (yes/no)

---

### Step 2: [Next action]
[Repeat for each migration step]

---

## Final Update

**Version field updates:**
```markdown
> **Version:** [Target Version]
```

Apply this to all affected files (listed below). Your `Last Updated` dates are preserved.

---

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] All new sections filled in with your data
- [ ] Changed sections adapted to new structure
- [ ] Removed sections archived
- [ ] Version field updated in all affected files
- [ ] Last Updated fields unchanged
- [ ] Test: run `init_week` and verify no warnings appear

---

## Rollback Instructions

If something breaks after upgrade:
1. Restore your pre-upgrade file versions
2. Report issue at `https://github.com/daviddgl/coach-operating-system/issues`
3. Include: your previous version, target version, and the step that failed

---

## Inline Bundle Generation (Bundled-Deployment Users)

After all migration steps are complete, if bundle generation is confirmed:

1. Assemble `cos_compiled.md` inline from migrated file contents (your data + new framework)
2. Concatenation order (same as `scripts/bundle.sh`):
   - `00_BOOT/README.md`
   - `01_KERNEL/coach_operating_system.md`, `coach_decision_protocol.md`, `personal_dna.md`
   - `02_CONFIG/practice_operating_system.md`, `practice_strategy.md`
   - `03_DRIVERS/client_portfolio.md`, all `client_card - [Name].md` files
   - `04_PROCESSES/quarterly_plan.md`
   - `05_COMMANDS/command_reference.md`, `system_prompt.md`
   - `06_BOARDROOM/boardroom.md`
3. Wrap each file with: `<!-- SOURCE FILE: [relative_path] -->`
4. Output full bundle as a single code block
5. Instruct user: replace existing `cos_compiled.md` in their platform knowledge base with this new bundle — no need to run `bundle.sh` manually

> **Platform note:** If output exceeds the platform's limit, split into 2–3 parts with clear paste-order instructions. `00_BOOT/bootstrap_prompt.md` in Custom Instructions stays unchanged.
```

**Chains With:** Run `prep_refresh` first (data should be current before framework changes are applied). After upgrade, run `init_week` to verify the system works correctly.

## 🎙️ BOARDROOM COMMAND

### `boardroom [topic]`

**Trigger:** High-stakes uncertainty — you need adversarial, multi-perspective input before deciding  
**Purpose:** Convene your virtual advisory council — activate the most relevant personas, get each perspective and probing questions, then synthesise into a decision-ready output

**OS Files to Read:**
- `06_BOARDROOM/boardroom.md` — §1 Working Principles, §2 Coach's Chair, §3 All Personas
- `01_KERNEL/personal_dna.md` — Goals, Constraints & Fears, Avoidance Patterns
- `01_KERNEL/coach_operating_system.md` — §12 Pressure Mode (is this session stress-driven?)

**Ask User For:**
- `[topic]` — The situation, decision, or challenge to bring to the boardroom (1–3 sentences of context)
- Session depth: **Quick scan** (3 personas, 5-min read) or **Full session** (4–5 personas, deeper analysis)

**Persona Selection Logic:**

Auto-select 3–4 personas based on topic type:

| Topic Type | Activate |
|------------|---------|
| Client relationship / trust / rapport | People Coach + Vulnerability Anchor + Challenger |
| Delivery / accountability / outcomes | Execution Force + Standards Anchor + Challenger |
| Strategy / positioning / niche | Narrative Strategist + Execution Force + Challenger |
| Multi-faceted / complex decision | All 4 core personas |
| Coach wellbeing / burnout / pressure | Vulnerability Anchor + Narrative Strategist + People Coach |

Always include the **Challenger** persona unless the topic is explicitly wellbeing-focused.

**Critical Files for Freshness:**
- 🟢 `boardroom.md` — review quarterly (no hard staleness trigger)
- 🟢 `personal_dna.md` — 30-day grace

**Output Format:**
```
# Boardroom Session — [Topic Summary]
**Date:** [Today]
**Session Depth:** [Quick / Full]

---

## Personas Activated
[List 3–4 personas selected, with one-line rationale for each]

**They Ask:**
1. [Probing question that challenges your framing]
2. [Second probing question that opens a new angle]

---

```

**Chains With:** `client_request [description]` (boardroom clarifies your position before running the decision protocol), `boundary_check [topic]` (boardroom helps think through whether and how to address a concern), `capacity_check` (if the boardroom surfaces a structural pattern)

---
