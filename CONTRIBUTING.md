# Contributing

## Scope
Contributions should preserve COS architecture and the logic/data separation model.

## Guidelines
- Keep edits minimal and focused
- Prefer updating existing templates over adding new framework layers
- Keep command output formats structured and concrete
- Maintain ethical boundary language for coaching contexts

## Versioning
- Record framework-level changes in `CHANGELOG.md`
- Keep user-specific data out of framework templates
