# Coach Operating System (COS)

A modular, markdown-based decision framework for independent career coaches.

## What this is
- A personal operating system to run coaching work with clarity and consistency
- A layered architecture separating philosophy, strategy, portfolio, and execution
- An AI-ready command interface for daily, weekly, planning, and decision workflows

## Layers
- `00_BOOT` — onboarding + bootstrap instructions
- `01_KERNEL` — your coaching philosophy + decision protocol + personal DNA
- `02_CONFIG` — practice identity + quarterly strategy
- `03_DRIVERS` — client portfolio + client cards
- `04_PROCESSES` — active quarterly plan
- `05_COMMANDS` — command reference + system prompt
- `06_BOARDROOM` — advisory personas for high-stakes decisions

## Quick start
1. Fill `01_KERNEL` first (`coach_operating_system.md`, `coach_decision_protocol.md`, `personal_dna.md`)
2. Define your practice in `02_CONFIG`
3. Build active roster in `03_DRIVERS`
4. Create current quarter in `04_PROCESSES`
5. Use commands in `05_COMMANDS/command_reference.md`

## Bundle for AI platforms
Run:

```bash
scripts/bundle.sh
```

This generates `bundle/cos_compiled.md` for single-file upload.
